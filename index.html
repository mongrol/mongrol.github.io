        <h3>XAnimGUI - 1996</h3>
        <p>A long time ago the Amiga had a CLI based movie player called Xanim.
            I didn't like CLI's then so I wrote a GUI for it using the Gadtools
            library in C. Other C programs included an IRC bot that wrote directly
            to the TCP port and when given channel ops, would go on a rampage
            kicking everyone out the channel before exiting in a memleak...
            Oh look! Its still on Aminet.</p>
        <a href="http://aminet.net/package/gfx/show/XanimGUIv13">XanimGUIv13</a>
        <p>With a fun readme and awesome license.</p>

                Short:        GUI frontend for Xanim. Final release.

                This is simply a GUI frontend for the UNIX derived Xanim animation
                player. If you have Xanim this prog is a must have.

        <h3>Mongscreen - 2000</h3>
        <p>In the early 2000's I did "value" stock trading. Mongscreen was a web
            application that scraped Hemscott, Yahoo and some other finance websites
            for company fundamental data, jammed it into a MySQL database and provided
            a search function to pull out stocks matching certain criteria.</p>
        <p>The scraper is written in Perl5 and the website was PHP4. It all ran
            on a FreeBSD box at home and was used by several peeps on the fool.co.uk
            forums. It was good, made me money and it was free to use. </p>

        <h3>Moolah - 2009</h3>
        Still money obsessed and unhappy with the state of finance apps I decided to
        write my own on a Mac. Written in Objective-C, Moolah was an envelope budgeting
        app. Like everything else I write it was buggy beyond belief and got quite unusable
        very quickly with a lot of transactions. I now have too much money and don't care. <p>

        <p>
            This was a tactics roguelike set in Victorian times with XCom like gameplay. Written in
            C++ and SFML. Great fun and an awesome learning experience. Game
            systems are amongst the most complex you can make as a programmer.
            A favourite feature was the name generator that would come up with
            great Victorian policeman names like "William Pocket" and "ALbert Cheeseborough"</p>
        <p>
            It even had its own little <a href="./teweb/">website</a>.
